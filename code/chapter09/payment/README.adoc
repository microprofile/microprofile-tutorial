== MicroProfile Fault Tolerance Implementation

The Payment Service implements comprehensive fault tolerance patterns using MicroProfile Fault Tolerance annotations:

=== Retry Policies

The service implements different retry strategies based on operation criticality:

==== Payment Authorization Retry (@Retry)
* **Max Retries**: 3 attempts
* **Delay**: 1000ms with 500ms jitter
* **Max Duration**: 10 seconds
* **Retry On**: RuntimeException, WebApplicationException
* **Use Case**: Standard payment authorization with exponential backoff

[source,java]
----
@Retry(
    maxRetries = 3,
    delay = 2000,
    maxDuration = 10000
    jitter = 500,
    retryOn = {RuntimeException.class, WebApplicationException.class}
)
----

=== Circuit Breaker Protection

Payment capture operations use circuit breaker pattern:

[source,java]
----
@CircuitBreaker(
    failureRatio = 0.5,
    requestVolumeThreshold = 4,
    delay = 5000
)
----

* **Failure Ratio**: 50% failure rate triggers circuit opening
* **Request Volume**: Minimum 4 requests for evaluation
* **Recovery Delay**: 5 seconds before attempting recovery

=== Timeout Protection

Operations with potential long delays are protected with timeouts:

[source,java]
----
@Timeout(value = 3000)
----

=== Bulkhead Pattern

The bulkhead pattern limits concurrent requests to prevent system overload:

[source,java]
----
@Bulkhead(value = 5)
----

* **Concurrent Requests**: Limited to 5 concurrent requests
* **Excess Requests**: Rejected immediately instead of queuing
* **Use Case**: Protect service from traffic spikes and cascading failures

=== Fallback Mechanisms

All critical operations have fallback methods that provide graceful degradation:

* **Payment Authorization Fallback**: Returns service unavailable with retry instructions

== Endpoints

=== GET /payment/api/payment-config
* Returns all current payment configuration values
* Example: `GET http://localhost:9080/payment/api/payment-config`
* Response: `{"gateway.endpoint":"https://api.paymentgateway.com"}`

=== POST /payment/api/payment-config
* Updates a payment configuration value
* Example: `POST http://localhost:9080/payment/api/payment-config`
* Request body: `{"key": "payment.gateway.endpoint", "value": "https://new-api.paymentgateway.com"}`
* Response: `{"key":"payment.gateway.endpoint","value":"https://new-api.paymentgateway.com","message":"Configuration updated successfully"}`

=== POST /payment/api/authorize
* Processes a payment authorization with retry policy
* **Retry Configuration**: 3 attempts, 1s delay, 500ms jitter

----

== Project Structure

* `src/main/java/io/microprofile/tutorial/PaymentRestApplication.java` - Jakarta Restful web service application class
* `src/main/java/io/microprofile/tutorial/store/payment/config/` - Configuration classes
* `src/main/java/io/microprofile/tutorial/store/payment/resource/` - REST resource endpoints
* `src/main/java/io/microprofile/tutorial/store/payment/service/` - Business logic services
* `src/main/java/io/microprofile/tutorial/store/payment/entity/` - Data models
* `src/main/resources/META-INF/services/` - Service provider configuration
* `src/main/liberty/config/` - Liberty server configuration

== Custom ConfigSource

The Payment Service implements a custom MicroProfile ConfigSource named `PaymentServiceConfigSource` that provides payment-specific configuration with high priority (ordinal: 600).

=== Available Configuration Properties

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Property
|Description
|Default Value

|payment.gateway.endpoint
|Payment gateway endpoint URL
|https://api.paymentgateway.com
|===

=== Testing ConfigSource Endpoints

You can test the ConfigSource endpoints using curl or any REST client:

[source,bash]
----
# Get current configuration
curl -s http://localhost:9080/payment/api/payment-config | json_pp

# Update configuration property
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key":"payment.gateway.endpoint", "value":"https://new-api.paymentgateway.com"}' \
  http://localhost:9080/payment/api/payment-config | json_pp

# Test payment processing with the configuration
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"cardNumber":"4111111111111111", "cardHolderName":"Test User", "expiryDate":"12/25", "securityCode":"123", "amount":100.00}' \
  http://localhost:9080/payment/api/payment-config/process-example | json_pp

# Test basic payment authorization
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  http://localhost:9080/payment/api/authorize | json_pp
----

=== Implementation Details

The custom ConfigSource is implemented in the following classes:

* `PaymentServiceConfigSource.java` - Implements the MicroProfile ConfigSource interface
* `PaymentConfig.java` - Utility class for accessing configuration properties

Example usage in application code:

[source,java]
----
// Inject standard MicroProfile Config
@Inject
@ConfigProperty(name="payment.gateway.endpoint")
private String endpoint;

// Or use the utility class
String gatewayUrl = PaymentConfig.getConfigProperty("payment.gateway.endpoint");
----

The custom ConfigSource provides a higher priority (ordinal: 600) than system properties and environment variables, allowing for service-specific defaults while still enabling override via standard mechanisms.

=== MicroProfile Config Sources

MicroProfile Config uses a prioritized set of configuration sources. The payment service uses the following configuration sources in order of priority (highest to lowest):

1. Custom ConfigSource (`PaymentServiceConfigSource`) - Ordinal: 600
2. System properties - Ordinal: 400
3. Environment variables - Ordinal: 300
4. microprofile-config.properties file - Ordinal: 100

==== Updating Configuration Values

You can update configuration properties through different methods:

===== 1. Using the REST API (runtime)

This uses the custom ConfigSource and persists only for the current server session:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key":"payment.gateway.endpoint", "value":"https://test-api.paymentgateway.com"}' \
  http://localhost:9080/payment/api/payment-config
----

===== 2. Using System Properties (startup)

[source,bash]
----
# Linux/macOS
mvn liberty:run -Dpayment.gateway.endpoint=https://sys-api.paymentgateway.com

# Windows
mvn liberty:run "-Dpayment.gateway.endpoint=https://sys-api.paymentgateway.com"
----

===== 3. Using Environment Variables (startup)

Environment variable names must follow the MicroProfile Config convention (uppercase with underscores):

[source,bash]
----
# Linux/macOS
export PAYMENT_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT=https://env-api.paymentgateway.com
mvn liberty:run

# Windows PowerShell
$env:PAYMENT_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT="https://env-api.paymentgateway.com"
mvn liberty:run

# Windows CMD
set PAYMENT_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT=https://env-api.paymentgateway.com
mvn liberty:run
----

===== 4. Using microprofile-config.properties File

Edit the file at `src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
# Update the endpoint
payment.gateway.endpoint=https://config-api.paymentgateway.com
----

Then rebuild and restart the application:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean package liberty:run
----

==== Testing Configuration Changes

After changing a configuration property, you can verify it was updated by calling:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:9080/payment/api/payment-config
----

== Documentation

=== OpenAPI

The payment service automatically generates OpenAPI documentation using MicroProfile OpenAPI annotations.

* OpenAPI UI: `http://localhost:9080/payment/api/openapi-ui/`

== MicroProfile Fault Tolerance Patterns

=== Retry Pattern

The retry pattern allows the service to automatically retry failed operations:

* **@Retry**: Automatically retries failed operations
* **Parameters**: maxRetries, delay, jitter, maxDuration, retryOn, abortOn
* **Use Case**: Transient failures in external service calls

=== Circuit Breaker Pattern

The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures:

* **@CircuitBreaker**: Tracks failure rates and opens circuit when threshold is reached
* **Parameters**: failureRatio, requestVolumeThreshold, delay
* **States**: Closed (normal), Open (failing), Half-Open (testing recovery)
* **Use Case**: Protect against downstream service failures

=== Timeout Pattern

The timeout pattern prevents operations from hanging indefinitely:

* **@Timeout**: Sets maximum duration for operations
* **Parameters**: value, unit
* **Use Case**: Prevent indefinite waiting for slow external services

=== Bulkhead Pattern

The bulkhead pattern limits concurrent requests:

* **@Bulkhead**: Sets maximum concurrent executions
* **Parameters**: value, waitingTaskQueue (for async)
* **Use Case**: Prevent system overload during traffic spikes

=== Fallback Pattern

The fallback pattern provides alternatives when operations fail:

* **@Fallback**: Specifies alternative method when operation fails
* **Parameters**: fallbackMethod, applyOn, skipOn
* **Use Case**: Graceful degradation for failed operations

== Fault Tolerance Best Practices

=== Configuring Retry Policies

When configuring retry policies, consider these best practices:

* **Operation Criticality**: Use more aggressive retry policies for critical operations
* **Retry Delay**: Implement exponential backoff for external service calls
* **Jitter**: Add random jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
* **Max Duration**: Set an overall timeout to prevent excessive retries
* **Abort Conditions**: Define specific exceptions that should abort retry attempts

=== Circuit Breaker Configuration

For effective circuit breaker implementation:

* **Failure Ratio**: Set appropriate threshold based on expected error rates (typically 0.3-0.5)
* **Request Volume**: Set minimum request count to prevent premature circuit opening
* **Recovery Delay**: Allow sufficient time for downstream services to recover
* **Monitoring**: Track circuit state transitions for operational visibility

=== Bulkhead Strategies

Choose the appropriate bulkhead strategy:

* **Synchronous Bulkhead**: Limits concurrent executions for thread-constrained systems
* **Asynchronous Bulkhead**: Provides a waiting queue for manageable load spikes
* **Isolation Levels**: Consider using separate bulkheads for different types of operations

=== Fallback Implementation

Implement effective fallback mechanisms:

* **Graceful Degradation**: Return partial results when possible
* **Meaningful Responses**: Provide clear error messages to clients
* **Operation Queuing**: Queue failed operations for later processing
* **Fallback Chain**: Implement multiple fallback levels for critical operations

=== Combining Fault Tolerance Annotations

When combining multiple fault tolerance annotations:

* **Execution Order**: Understand the execution order (Fallback → Retry → CircuitBreaker → Timeout → Bulkhead)
* **Compatibility**: Ensure annotations work together as expected
* **Resource Impact**: Consider the resource impact of combined annotations
* **Testing**: Test all combinations of annotation behaviors

== Troubleshooting Fault Tolerance Issues

=== Common Fault Tolerance Issues

==== 1. Ineffective Retry Policies

**Symptoms**:
* Operations fail without retrying
* Excessive retries causing performance issues

**Solutions**:
* Verify exceptions match retryOn parameter
* Check that delay and jitter are appropriate
* Ensure maxDuration allows sufficient time for retries

==== 2. Circuit Breaker Problems

**Symptoms**:
* Circuit opens too frequently
* Circuit never opens despite failures
* Circuit remains open indefinitely

**Solutions**:
* Adjust failureRatio based on expected error rates
* Increase requestVolumeThreshold if premature opening occurs
* Verify that delay allows sufficient recovery time
* Ensure exceptions are properly handled

==== 3. Timeout Issues

**Symptoms**:
* Operations timeout too quickly
* Timeouts not triggering as expected

**Solutions**:
* Adjust timeout duration based on operation complexity
* Ensure timeout is shorter than upstream timeouts
* Verify that timeout unit is properly specified

==== 4. Bulkhead Restrictions

**Symptoms**:
* Too many rejections during normal load
* Service overloaded despite bulkhead

**Solutions**:
* Adjust bulkhead value based on resource capacity
* Consider using asynchronous bulkheads with waiting queue
* Implement client-side load balancing for better distribution

==== 5. Fallback Failures

**Symptoms**:
* Fallbacks not triggering despite failures
* Fallbacks throwing unexpected exceptions

**Solutions**:
* Verify fallback method signature matches original method
* Ensure fallback method handles exceptions properly
* Check that fallback logic is fully tested

=== Diagnosing with Metrics

MicroProfile Metrics provides valuable insight into fault tolerance behavior:

[source,bash]
----
# Total number of retry attempts
curl https://localhost:9080/metrics?name=ft_retry_retries_total

# Bulkhead calls total
curl http://localhost:9080/metrics?name=ft_bulkhead_calls_total

# Timeout execution duration
curl http://localhost:9080/payment/metrics/application?name=ft_timeout_executionDuration_nanoseconds
----

=== Server Log Analysis

Liberty server logs provide detailed information about fault tolerance operations:

[source,bash]
----
tail -f target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/mpServer/logs/messages.log | grep -E "Retry|CircuitBreaker|Timeout|Bulkhead|Fallback"
----

Look for messages indicating:
* Retry attempts and success/failure
* Circuit breaker state transitions
* Timeout exceptions
* Bulkhead rejections
* Fallback method invocations

== Payment Flow

The Payment Service implements a complete payment processing flow:

[plantuml,payment-flow,png]
----
@startuml
skinparam backgroundColor transparent
skinparam handwritten true

state "PENDING" as pending
state "PROCESSING" as processing
state "COMPLETED" as completed
state "FAILED" as failed
state "REFUNDED" as refunded
state "CANCELLED" as cancelled

[*] --> pending : Create payment
pending --> processing : Process payment
processing --> completed : Success
processing --> failed : Error
completed --> refunded : Refund request
pending --> cancelled : Cancel
failed --> [*]
refunded --> [*]
cancelled --> [*]
completed --> [*]
@enduml
----

1. **Create a payment** with status `PENDING` (POST /api/payments)
2. **Process the payment** to change status to `PROCESSING` (POST /api/payments/{id}/process)
3. Payment will automatically be updated to either:
   * `COMPLETED` - Successful payment processing
   * `FAILED` - Payment rejected or processing error
4. If needed, payments can be:
   * `REFUNDED` - For returning funds to the customer
   * `CANCELLED` - For stopping a pending payment

=== Payment Status Rules

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Status
|Description
|Available Actions

|PENDING
|Payment created but not yet processed
|Process, Cancel

|PROCESSING
|Payment being processed by payment gateway
|None (transitional state)

|COMPLETED
|Payment successfully processed
|Refund

|FAILED
|Payment processing unsuccessful
|Create new payment

|REFUNDED
|Payment returned to customer
|None (terminal state)

|CANCELLED
|Payment cancelled before processing
|Create new payment
|===

=== Test Scenarios

For testing purposes, the following scenarios are simulated:

* Payments with amounts ending in `.00` will fail
* Payments with card numbers ending in `0000` trigger retry mechanisms
* Verification has a 50% random failure rate to demonstrate retry capabilities
* Empty amount values in refund requests trigger abort conditions

== Integration with Other Services

The Payment Service integrates with several other microservices in the application:

=== Order Service Integration

* **Direction**: Bi-directional
* **Endpoints Used**:
  - `GET /order/api/orders/{orderId}` - Get order details before payment
  - `PATCH /order/api/orders/{orderId}/status` - Update order status after payment
* **Integration Flow**:
  1. Payment Service receives payment request with orderId
  2. Payment Service validates order exists and status is valid for payment
  3. After payment processing, Payment Service updates Order status
  4. Payment status `COMPLETED` → Order status `PAID`
  5. Payment status `FAILED` → Order status `PAYMENT_FAILED`

=== User Service Integration

* **Direction**: Outbound only
* **Endpoints Used**:
  - `GET /user/api/users/{userId}` - Validate user exists
  - `GET /user/api/users/{userId}/payment-methods` - Get saved payment methods
* **Integration Flow**:
  1. Payment Service validates user exists before processing payment
  2. Payment Service can retrieve saved payment methods for user
  3. User payment history is updated after successful payment

=== Inventory Service Integration

* **Direction**: Indirect via Order Service
* **Purpose**: Ensure inventory is reserved during payment processing
* **Flow**:
  1. Order Service has already reserved inventory
  2. Successful payment confirms inventory allocation
  3. Failed payment may release inventory (via Order Service)

=== Authentication Integration

* **Security**: Secured endpoints require valid JWT token
* **Claims Required**:
  - `sub` - Subject identifier (user ID)
  - `roles` - User roles for authorization
* **Authorization Rules**:
  - View payment history: Authenticated user or admin
  - Process payments: Authenticated user
  - Refund payments: Admin role only
  - View all payments: Admin role only
