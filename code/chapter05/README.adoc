== Overview

This project demonstrates a microservices-based e-commerce application built with Jakarta EE and MicroProfile. The application is composed of multiple independent services that work together to provide a complete e-commerce solution.

[.lead]
A practical demonstration of MicroProfile capabilities for building cloud-native Java microservices.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This project is part of the official MicroProfile 6.1 API Tutorial.
====


== Services

The application is split into the following microservices:

[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===
|Service |Description

|User Service
|Manages user accounts, authentication, and profile information

|Inventory Service
|Tracks product inventory and stock levels

|Order Service
|Manages customer orders, order items, and order status

|Catalog Service  
|Provides product information, categories, and search capabilities

|Shopping Cart Service
|Manages user shopping cart items and temporary product storage

|Shipment Service
|Handles shipping orders, tracking, and delivery status updates

|Payment Service
|Processes payments and manages payment methods and transactions
|===

== Technology Stack

* *Jakarta EE 10.0*: For enterprise Java standardization
* *MicroProfile 6.1*: For cloud-native APIs
* *Open Liberty*: Lightweight, flexible runtime for Java microservices
* *Maven*: For project management and builds

== Quick Start

=== Prerequisites

* JDK 17 or later
* Maven 3.6 or later
* Docker (optional for containerized deployment)

=== Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/your-username/liberty-rest-app.git
cd liberty-rest-app
----

2. Start each microservice individually:

==== User Service
[source,bash]
----
cd user
mvn liberty:run
----
The service will be available at http://localhost:6050/user

==== Inventory Service
[source,bash]
----
cd inventory
mvn liberty:run
----
The service will be available at http://localhost:7050/inventory

==== Order Service
[source,bash]
----
cd order
mvn liberty:run
----
The service will be available at http://localhost:8050/order

==== Catalog Service
[source,bash]
----
cd catalog
mvn liberty:run
----
The service will be available at http://localhost:9050/catalog

=== Building the Application

To build all services:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean package
----

=== Docker Deployment

You can also run all services together using Docker Compose:

[source,bash]
----
# Make the script executable (if needed)
chmod +x run-all-services.sh

# Run the script to build and start all services
./run-all-services.sh
----

Or manually:

[source,bash]
----
# Build all projects first
cd user && mvn clean package && cd ..
cd inventory && mvn clean package && cd ..
cd order && mvn clean package && cd ..
cd catalog && mvn clean package && cd ..

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d
----

This will start all services in Docker containers with the following endpoints:

* User Service: http://localhost:6050/user
* Inventory Service: http://localhost:7050/inventory
* Order Service: http://localhost:8050/order
* Catalog Service: http://localhost:9050/catalog

== API Documentation

Each microservice provides its own OpenAPI documentation, available at:

* User Service: http://localhost:6050/user/openapi
* Inventory Service: http://localhost:7050/inventory/openapi
* Order Service: http://localhost:8050/order/openapi
* Catalog Service: http://localhost:9050/catalog/openapi
