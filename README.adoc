# Install Antora 
You can install Antora using npm. If you don't have npm installed, you can install it by following the instructions at https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node.

```
npm install -g @antora/cli @antora/site-generator-default 
```

# Building the site

You can build the site by running the following command in the root directory of the project:

```
antora antora-assembler.yml
```
This command will generate the site in the `build/site` directory. You can then open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the site.

# Running the site locally
You can run the site locally using Python's built-in HTTP server. First, navigate to the `build/site` directory:
```
cd build/site
```
Then, run the following command:
```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
This will start a local server on port 8080. You can then open your web browser and navigate to `http://<hostname>:8080` to view the site.
