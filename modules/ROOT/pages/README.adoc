This repo contains the source files that are used to build the _MicroProfile Tutorial_. The source files are authored in link:https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc]. AsciiDoc is similar to markdown but is particularly suited for user documentation. The source files are processed and integrated into the MicroProfile Tutorial site using link:https://antora.org/[Antora], which is a tool for building documentation sites.

== Running the Site Locally

After building the site, you can serve it locally using Python's built-in HTTP server:

[source,bash]
----
cd build/site
python3 -m http.server 8080
----

Then open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to view the site.
